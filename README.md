# Flatiron Rails Project

## Introduction

**Champion: A Football Playbook Manager**, is a simple app to create and manage playbooks. It is intended for football coaches to use as they plan their plays for upcoming games. There is a basic structure to the app:

Plays have two basic elements - the formation and the routes. For this project, I will keep it simple, and say that plays have many formations. A play will have a name and a description and a selection of formations that the play can be called from.

An expansion would allow for routes to be applied to the plays, so a play also has many routes. Then, the play would be composed of mulitple routes and formations.

A playbook will be a collection of plays for a specific game week or strategy. When a play is in a playbook, the preferred foramation (and/or routes) is selected and recored in the playbook.

Future updates - it would be neat to display the play as a diagram, and automatcially generate the formation and the routes as they are selectedâ€¦but I need to know more javascript to pull that off.
