## Introduction

**Champion: A Football Playbook Manager**, is a simple app to create and manage football playbooks and schedules. It is intended for football coaches to use as they plan their plays for upcoming games. There is a basic structure to the app:

Playbooks can be created. Plays can be created and added to playbooks. Opponents can be added.  And games can be scheduled against opponents.

An expansion would allow for routes to be applied to the plays, so a play also has many routes. Then, the play would be composed of mulitple routes. I could also have a library of formations that could be used to create plays. 

## Basic Usage

A user must first create an account, which can be done directly, or by logging in through Facebook.  After the account is created, the user can edit their profile, create a new playbook, make plays, are schedule games and create opponents.  A menu across the top provides access to all of these options once the user is logged in.
